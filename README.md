# KKLB_Tweaks
A plugin that tweaks some graphical settings for the game KoiKoi Love Blossoms (恋来い温泉物語) by ULTRANOVA Entertainment.

It improves what best quality looks like (Performance set to '1' in game settings), and also tweaks the "balanced" (2) and "fast" (3) Performance presets. The default Performance setting is also changed from '2' to '1'.

You can buy the game [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1840350/KoiKoi_VR_Love_Blossoms/) or [on DLsite](https://www.dlsite.com/pro/work/=/product_id/VJ01000460.html). The purchase contains both VR and non-VR versions (non-VR version is available as free DLC on Steam).

If the game is in Japanese, make sure you have the latest version and go to Settings (button with a cog icon in main menu) and select English in the dropdown setting at the bottom of the list.

## Download
Check the [releases](/../../releases) (only dll, no texture).

## How to use
1. Apply latest [64bit version of BepInEx v5.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) to the game.
2. Copy the plugin .dll to your BepInEx\plugins folder inside the game directory.

If you have a *very* fast GPU or play the game in desktop mode and don't care about FPS, you can make the game look slightly smoother by going into plugin settings (F1 if you have ConfigManager, otherwise look in the `BepInEx\config` folder) and increasing the "Best quality AA" setting from '4' to '8'.
